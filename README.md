A full stack e-commerce project with Angular (frontend), Spring-boot and MySQL (backend)
In this repository you'll find a full stack project of an e-commerce website.

We've created a shop that sells a variety of products.
In this repository you'll find 3 parts :
	- Front-end code
	- Back-end code
	- The SQL code needed.

To run this project you need first to build the back-end code and then run the front-end by using this command line : `ng serve`.
 Navigate then to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
